# QR-code
Simple python program that generate a qrcode of a url.

# Windows :poop: :zzz:
Make sure to have python installed, than just copy and paste this into the terminal and hit enter(obviously): 
```
pip install qrcode[pil] Pillow
```
After that just run the exe file

# Linux :penguin:
Sorry but you need to run it from terminal, just make sure you have all the dependencies. I'm sure since you are using a Linux distro you know what you are doing so don't need much guidance. 

## BUT if you are new on Linux: :beginner:
1) Welcome to this epic Linux adventure, where launching something involves so many steps you'll feel like a wizard by the end of it! Get ready to jump through hoops, cast some spells, and maybe even sacrifice a few bytes to the digital gods. But fear not, for when you finally succeed, you'll be overflowing with pride and ready to take on the next quest! 

2) HAVE FUN!!! :octocat: :shipit: :100:

ðŸ¤« Also, you might need to follow these next steps. Unless, of course, you're brave enough to sell your soul :ghost: to ChatGPT :raised_hands: or make a ritual offering to the Stack Overflow wizards! :no_good:
